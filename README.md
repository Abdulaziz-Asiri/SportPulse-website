This will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the package.json file.

Start the Development Server: After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server using the following command:

```
npm start
```
This will:

Start the development server.
Automatically open your browser at http://localhost:3000 (the default port).
Enable hot-reloading, meaning any changes you make in your code will be reflected instantly in the browser.
